Iteration: 1
Task: T-001 Stabilize header + toast-only auth hints
Status: done
Decisions:
- Removed inline auth hint element; guidance now via toast only.
- Fixed header height to 64px to eliminate layout shifts.
- Added auth toast debounce (5s) and removed duplicate unauthorized toast.
Learnings:
- Header layout shift was caused by the inline auth hint appearing in the header.

Iteration: 2
Task: T-002 Forward-only concise logs
Status: done
Decisions:
- Manual backups append captured output to /data/logs/backup.log and create /data/logs if missing.
- Backup script logs reduced to start and completion lines plus errors only.
Learnings:
- Cron already redirects backup output to the same log file; manual path needed explicit append.
